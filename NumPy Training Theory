NumPy is a Python library.
NumPy is short for "Numerical Python"

NumPy is used for working with arrays.It also has functions for working in domain of linear algebra, fourier transform, and matrices.
NumPy was created in 2005 by Travis Oliphant. It is an open source project and you can use it freely.

NumPy aims to provide an array object that is up to 50x faster than traditional Python lists.
The array object in NumPy is called ndarray

NumPy arrays are stored at one continuous place in memory unlike lists, so processes can access and manipulate them very efficiently.
This behavior is called locality of reference in computer science.

To install: C:\Users\Your Name>pip install numpy
Once NumPy is installed, import it in your applications by adding the import keyword: 
import numpy
import numpy as np

We can create a NumPy ndarray object by using the array() function.
NumPy Arrays provides the ndim attribute that returns an integer that tells us how many dimensions the array have.
